# Optimizing Dataframes Processing in Chunks

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the processing of large datasets in chunks using Pandas. When dealing with large CSV files, loading them entirely into memory can lead to performance issues. This project demonstrates efficient techniques for handling such datasets without overwhelming system resources.

## Features
- **Chunk-wise Processing:** Load and process large CSV files in manageable chunks.
- **Memory Optimization:** Reduce RAM usage by working with smaller data segments.
- **Performance Improvement:** Apply efficient filtering, aggregation, and transformation techniques on chunked data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
